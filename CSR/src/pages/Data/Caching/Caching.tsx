        Caching is the process of storing copies of files in a cache (temporary storage) to reduce the time it takes to access them. When a file is
        requested, the browser checks the cache to see if it has a copy of the file. If it does, the browser can retrieve the file from the cache
        instead of downloading it again from the server, which can improve the performance of the website.
